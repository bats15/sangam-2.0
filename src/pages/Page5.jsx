            Sangam is the official Studentsâ€™ Publication Board of the Indian Institute of Technology Jammu. 
            It was established to provide a structured platform for students to publish written and visual 
            content related to campus life, academics, culture, and current affairs. <br /><br />
            The board functions under the guidance of faculty advisor and is run by a team of student editors, 
            writers, designers, and contributors. Sangam publishes both digital and print editions, covering a 
            range of content such as interviews, event reports, articles, creative writing, and artwork contributed 
            by students. <br /><br />
            The publication aims to document institute activities, highlight student achievements, and maintain 
            a creative and intellectual record of each semester. Contributions to Sangam are open to all students 
            of IIT Jammu, and the board collaborates with various campus bodies to ensure accurate and inclusive 
            representation.
