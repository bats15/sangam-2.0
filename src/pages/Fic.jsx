          <em>Dear Readers,</em><br />
          <br />
          <em>
            I still remember when the idea of Sangam was first brought to me—
            just a spark in a student’s mind, full of excitement, uncertainty,
            and a lot of hope. And today, to see how far it has come; it's
            genuinely moving. From that first conversation with her to now, with
            such a strong, passionate team breathing life into it—it's nothing
            short of powerful. Sangam is not just a magazine, or not just a
            student publication board. It’s a voice. It’s a space where students
            pause amid the rush of deadlines and exams to write, express,
            reflect, and connect. And that’s something IIT Jammu truly
            needs—spaces like these that celebrate thought, emotion, and
            creativity. A space where the community feels connected and whole—
            where moments, memories, milestones, and the faces behind them all
            find a place. This isn’t about perfection. It never was. It’s about
            honesty. It’s about showing up with your stories, your ideas, your
            art, and daring to share it with others. That takes heart—and this
            team has plenty of it.
            <br />
            <br />
            To everyone who’s worked on Sangam, thank you for holding onto the
            vision and making it grow. And to those reading it—I hope you find
            something in these pages that stays with you.
