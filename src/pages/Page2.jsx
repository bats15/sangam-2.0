              Sangam began with a simple idea â€” that students need a space beyond academics to express, reflect, and create. We wanted a platform where thoughts, emotions, opinions, and imagination could come together â€” a true confluence of voices from across our campus. Over time, Sangam has grown from a quiet vision into a vibrant publication board, capturing the essence of IIT Jammu through stories, poems, articles, and art. Every edition reflects the spirit of our student community â€” honest, diverse, and ever-evolving. So, to every reader who has found their way here: Thank you for joining us.  We invite you to explore, to engage, and, if you feel inspired â€” to contribute. Because here at Sangam, your voice matters. Let your thoughts flow. Let them meet. Let them Sangam.
