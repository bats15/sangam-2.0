          INDIA’S FULL-LENGTH FEATURE FILM <br />
          EVEN BEFORE HOLLYWOOD MADE <br />
          ITS FIRST SOUND FILM?

          <em>
            Raja Harishchandra (1913), directed by Dadasaheb Phalke, was India’s first full-length
            feature film—17 years before Hollywood's first talkie <strong>The Jazz Singer</strong> (1927).
            Phalke was inspired by the life of Jesus but decided to adapt Indian mythology instead.
            He built the entire film industry from scratch—with no studios, no actors, and no audience at first!
